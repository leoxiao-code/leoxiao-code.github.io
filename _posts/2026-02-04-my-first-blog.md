Recently I've been interviewed by Google, during which I found myself hard to express myself and my knowledge of computer science. 

As a result, I decided to write my blog everyday or every week to share my studies and feelings.

This is my first English blog. I do hope I could become an outstanding programmer and fluent English speaker in the near future. 

Let's start right now!
