# Leo's English Blog

Hi, I'm Leo 👋

I'm learning to think and express my ideas in English.
This blog is where I practice writing, reflecting, and growing.

## Why I write in English

I used to feel nervous about making mistakes.
Now I focus more on clarity than perfection.

## What you'll find here

- Learning reflections
- Technical thoughts in simple English
- Personal growth notes

## Final thoughts

This is just the beginning.
